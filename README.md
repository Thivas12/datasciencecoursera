# Data Science Specialization - Course 1 - The Data Scientist's Toolbox - Course Project

I am doing data science specialization provided by John Hopkin's University in Coursera. So currently this is the first course's project. I learned about the basic tools we need to use in order to do data science projects. In this current excersize project I am gonna demonstrate the software setup which are R, RStudio(I'm using conda environment which I'm more comfortable), Github(Check out my other projects too).

Alright lets get into the project. First we have to,
* **Install R**
* **Install RStudio**
* **Open RStudio and take a screenshot**
* **Submit a screenshot of RStudio open on the screen using one of these format: png, jpg, gif, pdf**

Next we have to setup a GitHub account(**which I already have!!**), and should create a  repo called **datasciencecoursera**. Then submit the link to our account.
